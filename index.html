      <h3>About me!</h3>
      <br>
      <p>My name is Charles. I am a university graduate as of 2018.
        I have some work experience, especially in the I.T. sector.

        <br>

        I am and have been always intruiged by technology and the fast pace of how it progresses.
        This being the era of innovation, I can only imagine the amazing inventions that will emerge
        in the near future.
        The move toward recognising the importance of technology in the day-to-day operations of life
        will also prove beneficial to all and in addition, give a platform to tech-innovators to flex 
        their tech prowess!
        This gives me motivation and confidence in my decision to take up this course at Moringa School!
